		    <b>Hello, my name is Victor Treviño III, thank you for showing your interest in my candidacy to be your next Justice of the Peace for Precinct 6, Place 1.  I am asking for your support and vote in the Primary Election in March of 2020 and again in the General Election in November of 2020.

		    <b>When the Texas Legislature created the Justice of the Peace position back in the 1800s, they specifically did not require this judge position to have a law degree.  They did this to prioritize our Justices of the Peace first and foremost being products of our community, they would represent, knowing that these positions would be limited in the scope of their legal authority which would require a true member of the community to make fair and unbiased judgements rather than have a law degree. </font></b>

		    <b>My family’s roots go back 90 years and four generations in Precinct 6.  My great grandfather moved his family into Precinct 6’s Fifth Ward (El Crisol) neighborhood, where I still have family today.  Another of my great grandfathers moved his family into Precinct 6’s North Side, where my 90-year young grandmother still lives today; right behind Poppa Burger.  My mother, Precinct 6 Constable Silvia Trevino, was born in Fifth Ward’s El Crisol and raised North Side, attending and graduating from Looscan Elementary, Marshall Middle School, and Jeff Davis (now North Side) High School. My father, retired Precinct 6 Constable Victor Trevino Jr., immigrated to America over 60 years ago.  My father and his family settled in Precinct 6’s Second Ward neighborhood where he was raised, attending and graduating from Lubbock Elementary, Jackson Middle (now Navarro) Middle School, and Stephen F. Austin High School.  I was born in Precinct 6’s North Side, attending and receiving my baptismal from Holy Name Catholic Church.  Eventually my parents moved to Precinct 6’s East End, where I attended and graduated from Cage Elementary, Jackson (now Navarro) Middle School, and Stephen F. Austin High School.  Since then I have attended and received the rest of my sacraments from Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in the heart of Precinct 6’s Second Ward.

		    <b>I have been a hard worker my entire life, from cutting grasses when I was only 13 year old to make money for the summer, to becoming grocery sacker at Fiesta on Wayside at 16 years old.  After graduating Austin High School, I worked in the corporate world at EZ Pawn, becoming their youngest manager ever of one of their multimillion-dollar pawn shops at only 20 years of age.  After five years with EZ Pawn, I decided to go back to college, beginning at Houston Community College (HCC), eventually transferring to University of Houston Main Campus.  During my time in college, I waited tables at Pappasito’s (Richmond & Kirby).  After a couple of years waiting tables, I accepted a role as bar manager at The Cellar Bar on Richmond, between Kirby and Buffalo Speedway.  After a year of managing The Cellar Bar, my friend and business partner Markos Pappas and I decided to buy the bar, which we owned and operated for the next five years.

		    <b>After graduating the University of Houston Main Campus with a degree in History, I decided to sell my half of the bar and become a teacher at my alma mater, Stephen F. Austin High School.  Throughout my 13 years at Stephen F. Austin High School as a teacher, I have been a proud union member of the Houston Federation of Teachers (HFT); becoming our HFT union steward for the past 8 years.  In 2017 I went back to school and earned my Master’s in Education in Administration and Supervision from the University of Houston Main Campus.  Throughout my 13 years here at Austin, I have fought for equitable resource allocation for our students, fair pay standards and treatment for our teachers and support staff, ensuring our students did not get bussed to far away schools during our construction of our new building, and I have been a relentless advocate for the preservation of our community’s established history, culture and identity during gentrification.
