Dr. Lathan was removed due to her failures as an Interim Superintendent and nothing more.  Those failures include her attempt to siphon off some of our black and brown schools, as well as her new bus hub system, which is still a mess, but possibly more evident, was this school year while our district laid off teachers, clerks, custodians, bus drivers, and other support staff, her priorities were to decrease teachers‚Äô pay while she accepted her $150K dollar raise, bringing her new salary to $350K.  And just this week we found out while so many of our HISD employees were getting laid off and accepting more responsibilities due to those lay offs, at the beginning of this year Dr. Lathan secretly gave $25K and $27K raises to her Chief Operating Officer and her Area Superintendents, bringing all of their new salaries to over $200K each; yet she claims she puts our students first.  Actions speak louder than words, and Dr. Lathan‚Äôs actions consistently show us that enriching herself and her cronies are her number one priority, not our students.  üìö üçéüëçüèΩ

HISD voted against giving teachers and support staff a modest 5% raise which we were asking for, yet voted for giving certain principals a 26% raise, taking those principals‚Äô salaries from $90K to $113K.  Our Superintendent Richard Carranza did not object to his principals receiving their 26% raise, yet he did object to teachers and support staff receiving a meager 5% raise, claiming it would be ‚Äúfinancially irresponsible.‚Äù</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/victor.trevino.7161">Victor Trevi√±o III</a> on Monday, June 26, 2017</blockquote></div>

Last night in a 5-4 vote because of your support, five HISD Trustees voted with us to approve our step increase.  Thank you to Trustees Elizabeth Santos, Dr. Sergio Lira, Diana Davila, Anne Sung, and Holly Mar√≠a Flynn Vilaseca, who all stood with teachers by standing up to our Interim Superintendent to show her that it was  unacceptable for her to conceal teachers‚Äô pay cuts from her teachers and board members while she received her $150K pay raise ($350K total) and created new $170K positions for her friends.</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/victor.trevino.7161">Victor Trevi√±o III</a> on Friday, August 10, 2018</blockquote></div>

HISD executives have once again been caught hiding information that continues to allow them to enrich themselves, while they decrease teachers‚Äô upcoming expected salaries; all of which will have a direct effect on the standard of education the students of HISD receive.  Please share this video and tag your HISD school board member, tag your local elected officials, tag your local media, and tag a friend that works in HISD.  We need to send a message to our HISD interim superintendent that deceitful and despicable actions such as these are not what we expect from our leaders in HISD.

I am sorry Mr. Superintendent, trust is earned, not given, and you have not earned our trust!
